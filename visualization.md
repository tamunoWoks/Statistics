### VISUALIZATION
Visualization in Statistics is the process of turning raw data into visual representations like charts, graphs, and plots to make patterns, trends, and insights easier to understand.

#### IMPORTANCE OF VISUALIZATION
Visualization matters because it:
- Communicates complex data clearly and quickly
- Makes it easier to spot trends, patterns, and outliers
- Supports decision-making
- Helps non-technical audiences understand data

#### Common Types of Statistical Visualizations:
| Type             | Use Case                                           |

| **Line Chart**   | Show trends over time                              |
| **Scatter Plot** | Show relationships between two numerical variables |
