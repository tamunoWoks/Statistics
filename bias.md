#### BIAS
In statistics, **Bias** refers to a systematic error that leads to an incorrect or unfair representation of reality in data collection, analysis, interpretation, or presentation.  
It occurs when the results of a statistical analysis consistently deviate from the truth due to flaws in the method or assumptions.

### Types of Bias:
| Type of Bias          | Description                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sampling Bias**     | Occurs when the sample isn't representative of the population (e.g. surveying only city dwellers about rural life). |
| **Selection Bias**    | When some groups are more likely to be included/excluded in the sample.                                             |
| **Measurement Bias**  | When data collection tools or methods consistently skew results (e.g. faulty scale, leading questions).             |
| **Response Bias**     | When participants give false or misleading answers, often due to social pressure.                                   |
| **Publication Bias**  | Studies with positive results are more likely to be published, skewing perceptions.                                 |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Interpreting data in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs.                                                       |

#### Why Bias Matters:
- Leads to inaccurate conclusions
- Can mislead decision-making
- Reduces validity and reliability of studies
- Affects policy, health, justice, and more

#### How to Reduce Bias:
- Use random sampling
- Design clear and neutral questions
- Ensure proper calibration and training
- Be aware of confounding variables
- Blind the study (e.g., double-blind experiments)

**NOTE:** Bias is not the same as random error â€” bias is systematic and predictable, while random error is unpredictable and cancels out over time.
