## Correlation
Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

Measured with:
- The correlation coefficient 𝑟
  - Ranges from –1 to +1:
    - 𝑟 = +1: perfect positive correlation
    - 𝑟 = –1: perfect negative correlation
    - 𝑟 = 0: no linear relationship

**Example:**  
- As temperature increases, ice cream sales increase → **positive correlation**
- As speed increases, travel time decreases → **negative correlation**  
**Key Point:** Correlation only shows association, not cause.
