## Correlation
Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

Measured with:
- The correlation coefficient 𝑟
  - Ranges from –1 to +1:
    - 𝑟 = +1: perfect positive correlation
    - 𝑟 = –1: perfect negative correlation
    - 𝑟 = 0: no linear relationship

**Example:**  
- As temperature increases, ice cream sales increase → **positive correlation**
- As speed increases, travel time decreases → **negative correlation**  

**Key Point:** Correlation only shows association, not cause.

## Causation (Causal Relationship)
Causation means one event directly affects another — a change in variable A causes a change in variable B.  

**Example:**
- Smoking causes an increased risk of lung cancer.
- Pressing a gas pedal causes the car to move faster.

**Key Point:** Causation implies a mechanism or cause-effect relationship, not just a pattern.

#### Establishing Causation Requires:
- Controlled experiments
- Randomized trials
- Statistical modeling (e.g., regression + control variables)

### Correlation ≠ Causation
Just because two variables move together doesn’t mean one causes the other.  
They may be related due to:
- Coincidence
- A third variable (confounder)
- Reverse causality

**Example:**  
Ice cream sales and shark attacks are positively correlated.
- Why? Both increase in summer → season is a **confounding variable.**

### Confounding Variable
A **confounding variable** (also called a lurking variable or confounder) is a third variable that influences both the independent and dependent variables, distorting or hiding the true relationship between them.  

A confounder is a variable that:
- Affects the independent variable (cause)
- Affects the dependent variable (effect)
- Creates a false association or masks a real one

#### Real-World Example:
Let’s say a study finds:
- People who carry lighters are more likely to develop lung cancer.  

At first, it may seem like carrying a lighter causes cancer. But a confounding variable exists:
- Confounder: Smoking
  - Smoking causes people to carry lighters.
  - Smoking also causes lung cancer.  

So, the true cause is smoking, not carrying lighters. Smoking confounds the relationship.
