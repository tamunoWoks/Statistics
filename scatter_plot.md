### Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is a type of graph used in statistics to visually display the relationship between two numerical variables. Scatter plots are commonly used in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and are a foundation for regression analysis.
#### Key Features:
- Each point on the plot represents an individual data observation.
- The x-axis shows the values of one variable, and the y-axis shows the values of the other.
- Scatter plots help identify patterns, trends, and correlations (positive, negative, or none) between the variables.

Above is a scatter plot with a line of best fit (dashed black line) added to each graph:
- In the positive correlation, the line slopes upward.
- In the negative correlation, the line slopes downward.
- In the no correlation, the line is relatively flat, showing no clear relationship.

### Linear Relationships
A linear relationship is a relationship between two variables where the change in one variable results in a proportional and consistent change in the other. In simple terms, the data points form (or approximate) a straight line when plotted on a graph.
#### Characteristics of a Linear Relationship:
- Represented by the equation:  **洧녽=洧녴洧논+洧녪**
  
  where:
  - **洧녽** = dependent variable
  - **洧논** = independent variable
  - **洧녴** = slope (rate of change)
  - **洧녪** = y-intercept (value of **洧녽** when **洧논** = 0)

#### Types of Linear Relationships
- **Positive linear relationship:** as **洧논** increases, **洧녽** increases. (slope **洧녴** > 0)
- **Negative linear relationship:** as **洧논** increases, **洧녽** decreases. (slope **洧녴** < 0)

**Example:**  
If you double the number of hours you work and your earnings also double, the relationship between hours and earnings is linear.

**Note:**  
In a Scatter Plot, if the points lie close to a straight line, this suggests a strong linear relationship.
