### Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is a type of graph used in statistics to visually display the relationship between two numerical variables.
#### Key Features:
- Each point on the plot represents an individual data observation.
- The x-axis shows the values of one variable, and the y-axis shows the values of the other.
- Scatter plots help identify patterns, trends, and correlations (positive, negative, or none) between the variables.

Scatter plots are commonly used in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and are a foundation for regression analysis.

### Linear Relationships
A linear relationship is a relationship between two variables where the change in one variable results in a proportional and consistent change in the other. In simple terms, the data points form (or approximate) a straight line when plotted on a graph.
#### Characteristics of a Linear Relationship:
- Represented by the equation:  **𝑦=𝑚𝑥+𝑏**
  
  where:
  - 𝑦 is the dependent variable
  - 𝑥 is the independent variable
  - 𝑚 is the slope (rate of change)
  - 𝑏 is the y-intercept (value of 𝑦 when 𝑥 = 0)
