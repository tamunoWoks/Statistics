### Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is a type of graph used in statistics to visually display the relationship between two numerical variables.

#### Key Features:
- Each point on the plot represents an individual data observation.
- The x-axis shows the values of one variable, and the y-axis shows the values of the other.
- Scatter plots help identify patterns, trends, and correlations (positive, negative, or none) between the variables.

Scatter plots are commonly used in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and are a foundation for regression analysis.
