### Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is a type of graph used in statistics to visually display the relationship between two numerical variables. Scatter plots are commonly used in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and are a foundation for regression analysis.
#### Key Features:
- Each point on the plot represents an individual data observation.
- The x-axis shows the values of one variable, and the y-axis shows the values of the other.
- Scatter plots help identify patterns, trends, and correlations (positive, negative, or none) between the variables.

Above is a scatter plot with a line of best fit (dashed black line) added to each graph:
- In the positive correlation, the line slopes upward.
- In the negative correlation, the line slopes downward.
- In the no correlation, the line is relatively flat, showing no clear relationship.

### Linear Relationships
A linear relationship is a relationship between two variables where the change in one variable results in a proportional and consistent change in the other. In simple terms, the data points form (or approximate) a straight line when plotted on a graph.
#### Characteristics of a Linear Relationship:
- Represented by the equation:  **𝑦=𝑚𝑥+𝑏**
  
  where:
  - **𝑦** = dependent variable
  - **𝑥** = independent variable
  - **𝑚** = slope (rate of change)
  - **𝑏** = y-intercept (value of **𝑦** when **𝑥** = 0)

#### Types of Linear Relationships
- **Positive linear relationship:** as **𝑥** increases, **𝑦** increases. (slope **𝑚** > 0)
- **Negative linear relationship:** as **𝑥** increases, **𝑦** decreases. (slope **𝑚** < 0)

**Example:**  
If you double the number of hours you work and your earnings also double, the relationship between hours and earnings is linear.

**Note:**  
In a Scatter Plot, if the points lie close to a straight line, this suggests a strong linear relationship.

### Constants
In statistics and mathematics, a constant is a fixed value that does not change. 
- A constant can be a specific number (like 2, 3.14, or 100).
- A fixed value in a formula or equation that doesn’t vary with the input.  
In statistical equations, constants often appear in equations like a **Linear Equation: *y=mx+b***
- 𝑚 and 𝑏 are constants (slope and intercept).
- For a specific model, these values stay fixed once calculated.  
In Programming and Data, Constants may also refer to variables that are assigned once and not changed, like PI = 3.1416.
