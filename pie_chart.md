## Pie Charts in Statistics
A pie chart is a circular chart divided into slices, where each slice represents a proportion or percentage of a whole. It's used to visualize parts of a whole for categorical data.
#### Key Features:
- The entire circle = 100% of the data.
- Each slice = one categoryâ€™s contribution to the total.
- Useful for comparing proportions.
