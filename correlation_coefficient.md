## Correlation 
Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It tells you whether an increase in one variable is associated with an increase or decrease in another variable — and how closely they move together.

## The Correlation Coefficient (r)
The strength and direction of a correlation are usually measured by the correlation coefficient, denoted by 
𝑟.
