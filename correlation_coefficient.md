## Correlation 
Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It tells you whether an increase in one variable is associated with an increase or decrease in another variable — and how closely they move together.

## The Correlation Coefficient (r)
The strength and direction of a correlation are usually measured by the correlation coefficient, denoted by 
𝑟, and (−1 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 1).
| Value of $r$ | Meaning                          |
| :----------- | :------------------------------- |
| $r = 1$      | Perfect **positive** correlation |
| $r = -1$     | Perfect **negative** correlation |
| $r = 0$      | **No** correlation               |
| $r > 0$      | **Positive** correlation         |
| $r < 0$      | **Negative** correlation         |

### Types of Correlation:
1. **Positive Correlation:**
    - As one variable increases, the other also increases.
    - Example: Height and weight
2. **Negative Correlation:**
    - As one variable increases, the other decreases.
    - Example: Hours of TV watched vs. exam scores
3. **No Correlation:**
    - No clear relationship between variables.
    - Example: Shoe size vs. intelligence

### Visual Understanding:
- **Strong Positive:** Points form a tight line going up.
- **Strong Negative:** Points form a tight line going down.
- **No Correlation:** Points are scattered with no pattern.
