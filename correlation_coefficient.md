## Correlation 
Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It tells you whether an increase in one variable is associated with an increase or decrease in another variable — and how closely they move together.

## The Correlation Coefficient (r)
The strength and direction of a correlation are usually measured by the correlation coefficient, denoted by 
𝑟, and (−1 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 1).
| Value of $r$ | Meaning                          |
| :----------- | :------------------------------- |
| $r = 1$      | Perfect **positive** correlation |
| $r = -1$     | Perfect **negative** correlation |
| $r = 0$      | **No** correlation               |
| $r > 0$      | **Positive** correlation         |
| $r < 0$      | **Negative** correlation         |
