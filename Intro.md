### What is Statistics?
Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.  

It helps us make sense of large amounts of information by summarizing patterns and drawing conclusions. Statistics is widely used in fields like science, business, government, health, sports, and social research.  

There are two main types of statistics:
1. Descriptive Statistics
    - Focuses on summarizing and describing the features of a dataset.
    - Common tools: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, charts, and graphs.  
2. Inferential Statistics
    - Uses a sample of data to make predictions or generalizations about a larger population.
    - Involves probability theory, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression.

**Example:**
Imagine a teacher records the test scores of 100 students:
  - Descriptive stats would tell the average score and how spread out the scores are.
  - Inferential stats might help predict how future students might perform based on this data.  

In essence, statistics turns data into insights.
