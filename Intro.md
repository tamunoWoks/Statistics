### What is Statistics?
Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It helps us make sense of large amounts of information by summarizing patterns and drawing conclusions.

There are two main types of statistics:
1. Descriptive Statistics
    - Focuses on summarizing and describing the features of a dataset.
    - Common tools: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, charts, and graphs.  
2. Inferential Statistics
    - Uses a sample of data to make predictions or generalizations about a larger population.
    - Involves probability theory, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression.

**Example:**  
Imagine a teacher records the test scores of 100 students:
  - Descriptive stats would tell the average score and how spread out the scores are.
  - Inferential stats might help predict how future students might perform based on this data.  

### Data to Decisions
Statistics helps transform data into actionable information, which is crucial for decision-making across various fields such as social sciences, medicine, engineering, public policy, psychology, and more.  

Statistics is very useful, fun, universal in its applicability and crucial in our data-driven world. Yet the most important thing a statistician does is look at data.

#### INTERPOLATION
Interpolation in statistics is the process of estimating unknown values that fall within the range of known data points. If you have a set of data points and you want to estimate the value of a variable at a point that lies between two known values, you're performing interpolation.  

**Example:**  
Imagine you know the population of a town in 2010 and 2020:
- **2010:** 10,000 people
- **2020:** 15,000 people.  

If you want to estimate the population in 2015, interpolation helps you make that estimate based on the known trend.  

#### Types of Interpolation:
1. **Linear Interpolation:**  
    - Assumes the change between two points is linear.
    - Simple and commonly used.
      ### ðŸ”¹ Linear Interpolation Formula

To estimate the value of \( y \) at a point \( x \) between two known points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):

\[
y = y_1 + \frac{(x - x_1)(y_2 - y_1)}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
