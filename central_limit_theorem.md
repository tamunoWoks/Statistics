## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a fundamental concept in statistics that explains why many distributions tend to be approximately normal (bell-shaped) under certain conditions, even if the original data is not normally distributed.  

The Central Limit Theorem states that:
> If you take a large enough number of random samples from any population (with any shape distribution), the distribution of the sample means will tend to follow a normal distribution.
This is true regardless of the population's original distribution, provided:
- The sample size is sufficiently large (usually 𝑛 ≥ 30 is considered enough)
- The samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
- The population has a finite mean (μ) and finite variance (σ²).
