## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion) based on sample data. It evaluates two competing hypotheses:
1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)** – A default assumption (e.g., "no effect," "no difference").
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)** – The claim we want to test (e.g., "there is an effect").  

The goal of Hypothesis Testing is to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample to support a specific claim (called a hypothesis) about a population.

| Term                                        | Definition                                                                                                                |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**                 | A statement of **no effect**, **no difference**, or **status quo**. It is the hypothesis that we **test against**.        |
| **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_a$)** | A statement that **contradicts** the null — it represents what you're trying to prove.                                    |
| **Test Statistic**                          | A value calculated from sample data, used to decide whether to reject $H_0$.                                              |
| **p-value**                                 | The **probability** of observing a result as extreme as (or more extreme than) the sample result, assuming $H_0$ is true. |
| **Significance Level ($\alpha$)**           | A threshold (commonly 0.05) that determines how strong the evidence must be to reject $H_0$.                              |
| **Reject or Fail to Reject $H_0$**          | If p-value ≤ $\alpha$: reject $H_0$; if p-value > $\alpha$: fail to reject $H_0$.                                         |

### Steps in Hypothesis Testing:
1. State the Hypotheses:
  - Null hypothesis ($H_0$): e.g., "The mean is 50"
  - Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$): e.g., "The mean is not 50"
2. Choose Significance Level (𝛼, often 0.05)
3. Select the Appropriate Test:
  - z-test, t-test, chi-square test, etc., depending on data type and size
4. Calculate the Test Statistic
5. Compute the p-value
6. Make a Decision:
  - If p-value ≤ 𝛼: Reject $H_0$
  - If p-value > 𝛼: Fail to reject $H_0$
