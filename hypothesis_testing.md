## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion) based on sample data. It evaluates two competing hypotheses:
1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)** – A default assumption (e.g., "no effect," "no difference").
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)** – The claim we want to test (e.g., "there is an effect").
