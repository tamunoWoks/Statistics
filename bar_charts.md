## Bar Charts in Statistics
A bar chart (or bar graph) is a graphical representation of categorical data using rectangular bars. Each bar’s height (or length) represents the frequency or value of that category.

#### KEY FEATURES:
- Used to compare different categories.
- Bars can be vertical or horizontal.

- All bars are usually equally spaced.
- The length or height of the bar shows the count, percentage, or another measure.

#### TYPES OF BAR CHARTS:
|Type|Description|
|:---|:----------|
|Vertical Bar Chart|	Bars go up from the x-axis|
|Horizontal Bar Chart|	Bars go sideways from the y-axis|
|Grouped Bar Chart|	Shows multiple bars side-by-side for each category|
|Stacked Bar Chart|	Bars are stacked to show sub-categories|

#### When to Use Bar Charts:
- To compare values across different categories.
- To visualize counts or summaries of categorical data.
- For clear, easy-to-read data summaries.

**NOTE:** Barcharts are not to be confused with **Histograms**, which look similar but are used for continuous (not categorical) data.  

## Histograms in Statistics
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It looks similar to a bar chart but is used for continuous numerical data, not categorical data.

#### KEY FEATURES:
- Data is grouped into intervals (bins).
- The height of each bar shows the frequency (how many data points fall within that interval).
- No gaps between bars (unless there’s an empty bin), because the data is continuous.
