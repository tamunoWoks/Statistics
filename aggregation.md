### AGGREGATION 
Aggregation in Statistics is the process of combining multiple pieces of data into a single summary or representative value.  
Aggregation transforms raw data into summarized forms, making it easier to analyze, interpret, and draw conclusions.

#### Common Aggregation Functions:
| Function           | What It Does                    | Example                        |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| **Sum**            | Adds all values                 | Total sales in a month         |
| **Mean (Average)** | Computes the average value      | Average score in a test        |
| **Median**         | Middle value when sorted        | Median household income        |
| **Count**          | Number of items or observations | Number of customers            |
| **Min / Max**      | Finds smallest/largest value    | Lowest and highest temperature |
| **Mode**           | Most frequent value             | Most common product sold       |
