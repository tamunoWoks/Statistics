## Normal Distribution
In statistics, the **normal distribution** (or **Gaussian distribution**) is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its symmetric, bell-shaped curve. It is widely used in statistics due to its natural occurrence in many real-world datasets.

### Key Properties:
- **Symmetry**: Symmetric about the mean (μ).
- **Bell-shaped curve**: Highest density at the mean, tapering off equally on both sides.
- **Mean = Median = Mode**: All central measures coincide at the center.
- **Parameters**:
  - **Mean (μ)**: Determines the center of the distribution.
  - **Standard deviation (σ)**: Controls the spread (width) of the distribution. The bigger the wider.
- **Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7)**:
  - ≈68% of data in **μ ± σ**.
  - ≈95% of data in **μ ± 2σ**.
  - ≈99.7% of data in **μ ± 3σ**.
