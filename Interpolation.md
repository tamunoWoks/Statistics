### INTERPOLATION
**Interpolation** in statistics is the process of estimating unknown values that fall within the range of known data points. If you have a set of data points and you want to estimate the value of a variable at a point that lies between two known values, you're performing interpolation.  

**Example:**  
Imagine you know the population of a town in 2010 and 2020:
- **2010:** 10,000 people
- **2020:** 15,000 people.  

If you want to estimate the population in 2015, interpolation helps you make that estimate based on the known trend.  

#### Types of Interpolation:
1. **Linear Interpolation:**  
    - Assumes the change between two points is linear.
    - Simple and commonly used.
2. **Polynomial Interpolation:**  
    - Uses polynomials to fit more complex curves.
    - More accurate for non-linear trends but can be unstable with too many points.
3. **Spline Interpolation:**
    - Fits smooth curves (splines) between points.
    - Good for larger data sets where smoothness matters.
