#### Independence
In probability, independence means that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another. Two events are independent if knowing the result of one gives no information about the other.  

Two events A and B are independent if: **𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴)⋅𝑃(𝐵)**  
This means the probability that both A and B occur equals the product of their individual probabilities.
