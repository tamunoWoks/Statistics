## Variance
In statistics, Variance is a measure of how spread out or dispersed the values in a dataset are from the mean. It tells you how much the data varies.

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2
$$

The population variance is given by:  
$ \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2 $
