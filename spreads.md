## Variance
In statistics, Variance is a measure of how spread out or dispersed the values in a dataset are from the mean. It tells you how much the data varies.

### Definition:
The population variance $\sigma^2$ is:  

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2
$$  

| Symbol     | Name                | Description                                                                     |
| :--------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $\sigma^2$ | Population Variance | The average of the squared deviations from the population mean.                 |
| $N$        | Population Size     | The total number of data points in the population.                              |
| $\sum$     | Summation Symbol    | Indicates the sum of all the terms from $i = 1$ to $i = N$.                     |
| $i$        | Index of Summation  | A counter used in the summation, ranging from 1 to $N$.                         |
| $x_i$      | Data Value          | The $i$-th individual data point in the population.                             |
| $\mu$      | Population Mean     | The average of all data values in the population: $\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum x_i$. |

- **Larger variance** = data is more spread out.
- **Smaller variance** = data is more tightly clustered around the mean.

#### Example:
Let’s say your data is: 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9.  
Mean $\bar{𝑥} = 5 $  

Squared deviations: $\(2−5)^2+(4−5)2+(4−5)2+⋯+(9−5)2=32
