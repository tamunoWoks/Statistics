## Regression
Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In simpler terms, it helps you understand how one thing (like a personâ€™s salary) depends on something else (like years of experience).

### Why Use Regression?
Regression is used to:
- Predict values (e.g., predicting housing prices based on size and location)
- Identify trends or patterns
- Determine the strength and type of relationships between variables
