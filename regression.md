## Regression
Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In simpler terms, it helps you understand how one thing (like a personâ€™s salary) depends on something else (like years of experience).

### Why Use Regression?
Regression is used to:
- Predict values (e.g., predicting housing prices based on size and location)
- Identify trends or patterns
- Determine the strength and type of relationships between variables

### Types of Regression:
1. **Linear Regression:** Models the relationship as a straight line.
2. **Multiple Linear RegressionL:** Used when there are two or more independent variables.
3. **Nonlinear regression:** Used when the relationship between variables is not a straight line.

## Linear Regression
Linear Regression is the simplest and most commonly used statistical method for modeling the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line through the data.  

It helps you predict the value of a dependent variable (also called output or response) based on the value of an independent variable (also called input or predictor).
