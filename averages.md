## Mean
The **mean** of a set of values is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values. It is is one of the most common measures of central tendency which gives you an idea of the **“average”** value in a dataset.  
  - Mean = $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$

#### Example:
If test scores are: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90.  
Then: $\bar{x}$ = (70+75+80+85+90)/5 = 400/5 = 80.  
✅ The average score is 80.

### Types of Mean:
| Type                | Description                                    |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Arithmetic Mean** | Regular average (most common)                  |
| **Weighted Mean**   | Accounts for importance/weight of values       |
| **Geometric Mean**  | Used in growth rates, percentages, and finance |
| **Harmonic Mean**   | Used in rates, like speed or efficiency        |

### When to Use the Mean:
✅ Use the mean when:
- Data is quantitative
- Data is symmetric (not skewed)
- You want a summary value of the dataset

❌ Avoid the mean when:
- The dataset contains extreme outliers
- Data is categorical or ordinal

### Summary:
| Term                   | Mean (Average)                                   |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                | Measures **central tendency**                    |
| Formula                | $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$                   |
| Sensitive to outliers? | ✅ Yes                                            |
| Common in              | Descriptive stats, probability, machine learning |

## Median
The **median** is the value in the center of a sorted list of numbers. It divides the data into the lower 50% and the upper 50%, or simply it's the middle value when the data is ordered.

#### How to Calculate the Median:
1. Arrange the data in ascending order.
2. If the number of values 𝑛 is:
    - Odd → median is the middle value
    - Even → median is the average of the two middle values

#### When to Use the Median:
✅ Use the median when:
- Your data is skewed (e.g. income)
- You have outliers
- You are working with ordinal or ranked data
