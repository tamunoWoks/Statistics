## Mean
The **mean** of a set of values is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values. It is is one of the most common measures of central tendency which gives you an idea of the **“average”** value in a dataset.

#### Example:
If test scores are: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90.  
Then: 𝑥ˉ = (70+75+80+85+90)/5 = 400/5 = 80.  
✅ The average score is 80.
