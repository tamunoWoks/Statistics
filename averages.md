## Mean
The **mean** of a set of values is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values. It is is one of the most common measures of central tendency which gives you an idea of the **“average”** value in a dataset.

#### Example:
If test scores are: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90.  
Then: 𝑥ˉ = (70+75+80+85+90)/5 = 400/5 = 80.  
✅ The average score is 80.

### Types of Mean:
| Type                | Description                                    |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Arithmetic Mean** | Regular average (most common)                  |
| **Weighted Mean**   | Accounts for importance/weight of values       |
| **Geometric Mean**  | Used in growth rates, percentages, and finance |
| **Harmonic Mean**   | Used in rates, like speed or efficiency        |

### When to Use the Mean:
✅ Use the mean when:
- Data is quantitative
- Data is symmetric (not skewed)
- You want a summary value of the dataset

❌ Avoid the mean when:
- The dataset contains extreme outliers
- Data is categorical or ordinal
