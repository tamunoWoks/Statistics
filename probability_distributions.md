### Continuous Probability Distribution
A ***continuous probability distribution*** describes the probabilities of outcomes for a continuous random variable that can take any value within a range (possibly infinite).

### Continuous Random Variable
A continuous variable:
- Can take infinitely many values within a given interval
- Examples:
  - Heights of people (e.g., 170.2 cm)
  - Time to complete a task (e.g., 3.74 seconds)
  - Weight, temperature, distance, etc.

### Key Properties:
- The probability of any exact value is 0:
   - 𝑃(𝑋=𝑎)=0  
Why? Because there are infinitely many possible values.
- We calculate probabilities over intervals:   
  - 𝑃(𝑎≤𝑋≤𝑏)=Area under the curve from 𝑎 to 𝑏
