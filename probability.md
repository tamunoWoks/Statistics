### PROBABILITY
Probability is the mathematical study of uncertainty. It quantifies how likely an event is to occur, on a scale from 0 to 1, where:
- 0 means the event is impossible
- 1 means the event is certain

**Example:**  
If you roll a fair 6-sided die:
- Probability of getting a 4 = 1/6

#### How Is Probability Related to Statistics?
| Aspect          | Probability                                  | Statistics                                             |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Direction**   | Starts with known model → predicts outcomes  | Starts with data → infers model or relationships       |
| **Purpose**     | To model uncertainty before data is observed | To analyze and interpret observed data                 |
| **Example Use** | What's the chance of rain tomorrow?          | Based on past weather, how often does it rain in June? |
| **Approach**    | **Theoretical** (predictive)                 | **Empirical** (data-driven)                            |

#### Relationship Summary:
- **Probability is forward-looking:** it helps you predict outcomes before an experiment.
- **Statistics is backward-looking:** it helps you learn from or analyze outcomes after they happen.
- **They work hand in hand:** probability builds the foundation for many statistical methods (like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, Bayesian inference).

#### Key Note:
While statistics involves analyzing data to infer possible causes, probability focuses on predicting data based on known causes. Understanding probability is important as it provides the language to describe the connection between data and underlying causes. 

#### Understanding Probability with a Fair Coin Example
A fair coin is a coin where:
- There are only two possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T)
- Both outcomes are equally likely.

#### Probability Formula:
𝑃(event) = Number of favorable outcomes/Total number of possible outcomes
 
#### Examples:
1. Probability of Getting Heads:
   - Favorable outcome = Heads (1 outcome)
   - Total outcomes = 2 (Heads or Tails)  
          𝑃(Heads) = 1/2 = 0.5

2. Probability of Getting Tails:  
          𝑃(Tails) = 1/2 = 0.5

So, each side has a 50% chance (or 0.5 probability) of appearing on any single flip.
