### PROBABILITY
Probability is the mathematical study of uncertainty. It quantifies how likely an event is to occur, on a scale from 0 to 1, where:
- 0 means the event is impossible
- 1 means the event is certain

**Example:**  
If you roll a fair 6-sided die:
- Probability of getting a 4 = 1/6

#### How Is Probability Related to Statistics?
| Aspect          | Probability                                  | Statistics                                             |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Direction**   | Starts with known model → predicts outcomes  | Starts with data → infers model or relationships       |
| **Purpose**     | To model uncertainty before data is observed | To analyze and interpret observed data                 |
| **Example Use** | What's the chance of rain tomorrow?          | Based on past weather, how often does it rain in June? |
| **Approach**    | **Theoretical** (predictive)                 | **Empirical** (data-driven)                            |

#### Relationship Summary:
- **Probability is forward-looking:** it helps you predict outcomes before an experiment.
- **Statistics is backward-looking:** it helps you learn from or analyze outcomes after they happen.
- **They work hand in hand:** probability builds the foundation for many statistical methods (like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, Bayesian inference).
