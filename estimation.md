## Estimation 
Estimation in statistics & probability is the process of using sample data to make an informed guess (or inference) about an unknown population parameter.  

In simple terms, Estimation answers questions like:
- What is the average height of all students in a school based on a sample?
- What is the probability of a customer buying a product, based on survey results?

### Types of Estimation:
| Type                    | Description                                                         |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Point Estimation**    | Gives a **single value** as an estimate of the population parameter |
| **Interval Estimation** | Gives a **range of values** (called a confidence interval)          |

#### Why Estimation Matters:
- Itâ€™s impractical or impossible to measure an entire population.
- Estimation allows us to make data-driven decisions based on samples.
- It's at the core of statistical inference.

#### Key Concepts in Estimation:
| Term                 | Meaning                                                              |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Estimator**        | A rule/formula used to calculate an estimate (e.g. $\bar{x}$)        |
| **Estimate**         | The actual value calculated from a sample                            |
| **Bias**             | If the estimator systematically over- or underestimates the truth    |
| **Efficiency**       | How close estimates are to the true value across many samples        |
| **Confidence Level** | Probability that the interval contains the true parameter (e.g. 95%) |

## Estimator
An **estimator** is a statistical method or function that gives an approximate value (estimate) of an unknown parameter of a population (like mean, variance, proportion) using data from a sample. It is a formula or rule used to calculate an estimate of a population parameter based on sample data.
