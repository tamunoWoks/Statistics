## Estimation 
Estimation in statistics & probability is the process of using sample data to make an informed guess (or inference) about an unknown population parameter.  

In simple terms, Estimation answers questions like:
- What is the average height of all students in a school based on a sample?
- What is the probability of a customer buying a product, based on survey results?

### Types of Estimation:
| Type                    | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Point Estimation**    | Gives a **single value** as an estimate of the population parameter |
| **Interval Estimation** | Gives a **range of values** (called a confidence interval)          |
