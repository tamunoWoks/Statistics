## Binomial Distribution
The **Binomial Distribution** models the number of **successes** in a fixed number of independent **Bernoulli trials**, where each trial has the same probability of success.

### Characteristics:
- There are **only two outcomes** per trial: success or failure
- A **fixed number** of trials *n*
- The **probability of success** *p* is constant
- Each trial is **independent**
