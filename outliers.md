## Outliers
In Statistics **Outliers** are data points that are significantly different from other observations in a dataset. They lie far outside the overall pattern and may affect statistical analyses.

### What Causes Outliers?
- Measurement error
- Data entry mistakes
- Genuine variability in the data
- Sampling anomalies

### Why Are Outliers Important?
- They can **skew** the mean and standard deviation.
- They may indicate **special cases**, **anomalies**, or **errors**.
- They can **influence models**, especially in regression and machine learning.

### Methods to Detect Outliers:
1. Using the Z-score
2. Using the IQR (Interquartile Range)
3. Box plots.

### What to Do with Outliers:
- **Investigate**: Is it an error or a valid extreme case?
- **Remove**: If itâ€™s a mistake or irrelevant
- **Keep**: If it provides meaningful insight
- **Transform**: Apply techniques like log transformation or robust statistics
