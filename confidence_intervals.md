## Confidence Intervals
A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the **true population parameter** (like the mean or proportion) with a certain level of confidence.
> It gives an **estimated range** that is likely to include an unknown population parameter.

### Why Use Confidence Intervals?
- To **estimate population parameters** when we can only collect sample data.
- To express **uncertainty** in estimates.
- To make **informed decisions** based on data.
