## Confidence Intervals
A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the **true population parameter** (like the mean or proportion) with a certain level of confidence.
> It gives an **estimated range** that is likely to include an unknown population parameter.

### Why Use Confidence Intervals?
- To **estimate population parameters** when we can only collect sample data.
- To express **uncertainty** in estimates.
- To make **informed decisions** based on data.

### **Key Concepts:**
1. **Confidence Level (1 - α)**  
   - Probability that the interval contains the true parameter (e.g., 95%, 99%).
   - Common choices: 90%, 95%, 99%.
2. **Margin of Error (ME)**  
   - Half the width of the CI, representing precision.  
   - Formula:  $\text{ME} = \text{Critical Value} \times \text{Standard Error (SE)}$
3. **Critical Value**  
   - Depends on the distribution:
     - **Z-score** (Normal dist.) for large samples or known σ.
     - **T-score** (T-dist.) for small samples with unknown σ.
