## Confidence Intervals
A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the **true population parameter** (like the mean or proportion) with a certain level of confidence.

> It gives an **estimated range** that is likely to include an unknown population parameter.

For example:
> "We are 95% confident that the population mean lies between 48.5 and 52.3."
