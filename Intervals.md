### INTERVALS
An **interval** in statistics refers to a range of values used to group or organize data — especially in histograms, frequency tables, and grouped data analysis.
#### In a Histogram:
- Intervals (also called bins) are used to split continuous data into segments.
- Each interval covers a specific range of values, and the frequency of data points within each interval is counted.

**Example:**  
If you're measuring people's heights in cm:
- Interval 1: 140–149
- Interval 2: 150–159
- Interval 3: 160–169
- Interval 4: 170–179  

Each of these ranges is an interval, and the height of the bar (in a histogram) would show how many people fall into each height range.  

####  Important Terms:
|Term|Description|
|:---|:----------|
|Lower Bound|The smallest value in the interval|
|Upper Bound|The largest value in the interval|
|Width|Difference between upper and lower bound (e.g. 160–150 = 10)|
|Class Interval|Another name for a bin or group in grouped data|

####  Why Use Intervals?
- To simplify large datasets.
- To observe patterns in continuous data.
- To create frequency distributions and histograms.
